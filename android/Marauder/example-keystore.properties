#     storeFile=release.jks
#     storePassword=myStorePassword
#     keyAlias=myKeyAlias
#     keyPassword=mykeyPassword
#
# Then you can build a release APK with the following Gradle command:
#     ./gradlew PkeystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties assembleRelease
#
# Or you can modify the configuration in the project gradle.properties file:
#     keystorePropertiesFilename=release-keystore.properties
#
storeFile=myStoreFileLocation
storePassword=myStorePassword
keyAlias=myKeyAlias
keyPassword=mykeyPassword
